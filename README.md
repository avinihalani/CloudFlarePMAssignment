Cloudflare Workers Feedback Insights Prototype

This repository contains a small prototype built with Cloudflare Workers to explore how user feedback can be collected, analyzed at the edge, and aggregated into lightweight product insights.

The project uses Workers AI for basic feedback analysis, D1 for storing raw submissions, and Cloudflare KV for fast aggregation of feedback categories. It is intentionally minimal and focused on demonstrating architecture and product concepts rather than production completeness.

A live demo is deployed on Cloudflare Workers and included in the project submission.
